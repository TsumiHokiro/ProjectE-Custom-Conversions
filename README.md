# ProjectE-Custom-Conversions
Custom conversion values I've typed out for ProjectE.

Currently done:
ExtraCells, Mekanism(Must also disable dust blacklisting in the Mapper.cfg file.), Applied Energistics 2, Rotarycraft.

Planned:
ReactorCraft, Electricraft, Thermal Expansion (Liquids, Ducts, etc)

Installation: Just stick JSON files in your config/ProjectE/customConversions folder.

Want other mods? Ask and I'll do them if I have time.
